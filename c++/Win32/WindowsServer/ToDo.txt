Here's the original codeproject project (probably with updates):

			Working on NT service that can keep Ormap running in "UBLF loop mode".
			
			Not working, do we need to install as admin?
				Resetting the admin password on this box.
				Found the fucking password complexity requirements editor.
				control panel->admin tools->local security policy
					(there is an equivalent "domain security policy" for the domain admin, it seems)
				security settings->account policies->password policy
				then disable all the bullshit!

			Not the problem.  
			
			Here's how to INSTALL:

				e:
				cd E:\Michael's Data\Software Development\Samples\XYNTService\Debug
				xyntservice -i
					log should say #ServiceTitle# installed
				open Control Panel->Admin Tools->Services, #ServiceTitle# should be there.
				select and start the service
				all the apps defined in the INI file should start

			To REMOVE the service:
				open Control Panel->Admin Tools->Services, #ServiceTitle# should be there.
				kill all apps that the service started
				select and stop the service (before it restarts the apps)

				e:
				cd E:\Michael's Data\Software Development\Samples\XYNTService\Debug
				xyntservice -u
					log should say #ServiceTitle# removed
					if you refresh services list, it should be gone

			awesome!
			you can also add command line parameters to the command.
			just what we need.
			you can also change the user that the server runs under, but be careful, it
				may prevent access to registry/network shares/etc.

			It's all done in this project:
				E:\Michael's Data\Software Development\Samples\XYNTService\Debug
			
			which currently sets up this service:
				"Michael's Wee Little Notepad Server"

			new service:
                ORMapService
                E:\Michael's Data\Software Development\Samples\MFC\Temp\Reusable\Win32\WindowsServer
